2019-03-10 19:22:11,"@SalomonSoup   I just did a Google search of your facial image to find out that you are not you.  Perhaps I should do that too. Take a photo of someone else's face from a stock photo site and use it to represent my page. However, to be sure, I won't be choosing a woman's photo."

2019-03-10 18:30:22,Well the reason I asked is that I‚Äôll probably end up googling something I would google:) that‚Äôs the bias we must all overcome. If you only look where you‚Äôd normally look - - you‚Äôll only see what you‚Äôd normally see. (I‚Äôll stock through your week old tweets.)

2019-03-10 17:08:30,Nothing you just said is accurate. Just google ‚Äúcorporate profits from trump tax cut‚Äù. Stock buy backs galore to increase stock price. Virtually nothing went to workers.
2019-03-10 16:45:15,It's also fun to google a private corp number from a CSE document only to see its owned by someone on twitter who recently started to tweet the stock lol
2019-03-10 16:37:39,'I don't understand the subject but I'll google things that support my premise and send them to you'.  Seems to be your stock response and general understanding of most things you've been whitering on about.  Confirmation bias exemplified.
